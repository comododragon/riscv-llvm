## Introduction

This is a fork from riscv-llvm project (https://github.com/riscv/riscv-llvm), featuring pattern
detection and substitution for simple for loops, making the use of Xvec vector instructions. An
implementation of an Xvec-enabled RISC-V processor is available at
https://github.com/comododragon/vscale.
